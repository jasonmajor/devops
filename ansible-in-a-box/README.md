# Ansible-in-a-box
Everything you need to get started with Ansible under one directory
This is what I use to demo Ansible for the first time

TODO: Better details

What is Ansible?
Ansible can configure and install software in parallel on multiple remote servers from just one central control server

Why Ansible?
It's easy.
No software to install on remote servers
No background process to run on control or remote servers
Just need ssh access from control to remote servers
 
Requirements
Control server
Python 2.6 or 2.7
jinja2
PyYAML
paramiko
pycrypto >= 2.6
setuptools


Remote server
Python 2.4 - 2.7
